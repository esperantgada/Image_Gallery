Image Gallery App
===============

This is an assignment for internship. It's a task given by the employer to test applicants skills.

An app that searches images from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/) API displays them.
The user can directly get  a list of images from the API and displays see them on the screen or 
search images by name from the API.


How does it work?
================
By default, it has a list of cats on the screen. This is achieved with [flickr.photos.getRecent](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.getRecent)
The user can use the search screen from the navigation drawer bar to enter a query depending on what
he wants to search. After entering his query, he will get a list of photos or images. This is done 
with [flickr.photos.search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html)

These screens explain the above description:

<img src="screenshots/s1.jpg" width="150" /> | <img src="screenshots/s2.jpg" width="150" /> | <img src="screenshots/s3.jpg" width="150" /> | <img src="screenshots/s4.jpg" width="150" /> | <img src="screenshots/s5.jpg" width="150"/> | <img src="screenshots/s6.jpg" width="150" />
